The NOAA Office for Coastal Management's website is dedicated to supporting coastal and Great Lakes communities and ecosystems. It features four main programs: National Coastal Zone Management Program, National Estuarine Research Reserve System, Coral Reef Conservation Program, and Digital Coast. These initiatives focus on enhancing community and ecosystem resilience, leading estuary science, conserving coral reefs, and providing data, tools, and training for coastal issues. The site also highlights funding opportunities, fellowship programs, impact stories, and fast facts about coastal demographics, economics, and environmental challenges.
